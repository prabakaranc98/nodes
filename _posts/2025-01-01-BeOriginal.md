# Be Original: Just Do Things with Clarity and Focus

## DO NOT Get Caught or Swayed by Trends or What the Crowd Wants

I feel comfortable and “original”—unfiltered and factual to the self—when I write this on an untitled Google Document. However, whenever I write on platforms like Medium, Notion, or especially LinkedIn, I get swayed by “the need to put hooks that catch more engagement or increase the hype.”

### Reflections from December 31st, 2024

The year started with a new job and title, along with the hope that *“I will make an impact”* in the contemporary space of Gen AI. However, as the year unfolded, I faced disappointments, illusions, and distractions—many of which were self-induced.  

Despite these setbacks, 2024 brought clarity: *“I have not utilized my full potential.”* I was less resourceful, less collaborative, and often shared ideas with a “sleepy crowd.” Yet, I remain motivated to use the residual energy to make a meaningful impact.

### The Sabotaging Power of Trends

When I reflect, I notice how community narratives and my own expectations have created an intrinsic sabotage. In early 2024, I explored Tamil NLP and LLMs but quickly lost excitement, questioning their value and right consumption.  

A duality in my nature—oscillating between *“applied research”* and *“entrepreneurship”*—created conflict and hindered meaningful progress in either direction.

### The Burden of Influence and Judgement

As my career progressed, I felt increasingly burdened by judgment and the pressure of status quo:  
- *“Oh, I should not talk about this; people might disconnect.”*  
- *“I should make a strong story or share my opinion based on conceptual understanding.”*

These conflicting thoughts made me run in circles, fueled by interactions and encounters across platforms that often diverged from my true aspirations.

### Rediscovering Originality Amidst Health Challenges

A short resting period due to a pancreatitis breakout offered clarity. I realized that originality requires consistent effort and compounding to become visible and impactful. This realization reaffirmed the need to streamline my approach.

However, inconsistency and procrastination hindered me. Initiatives like *WeCooC* and *beyond-dotfit*—intended to share unconventional knowledge in Data Science—didn’t take off due to a lack of clear narrative and mission.  

I also abandoned promising ideas like a MicroSaaS-based AI assistant designed to transform “thoughts into action.” Despite building designs and debating its potential, I quit midway, dismissing it as “no longer exciting.”

### Immaturity and Lessons Learned

In my immaturity, I wanted everything to happen instantly. Great creators often struggle to convince people to adapt and use their outputs. I failed to embrace the journey, often distracted by thoughts like:  
- *“Why don’t people care about what I do?”*  

The truth is, people care only when you’ve achieved visible success. As I’ve learned, *“They just want a delicious and colorful appearance, even if it’s just a simple sugar candy.”*

### Moving Forward

As I studied in Control Systems:  
> **“If something can be measured, then it can be controlled.”**

Now, I’ve identified my issues and devised measures to overcome them. A senior well-wisher reminded me:  
> **“The world is your oyster.”**

These words reignite my determination. I will stick to my ideas, trust the journey, and make my mark with hope, determination, and a fresh start toward the New Year.

### Final Thoughts

Keep going.
